## Context and Purpose

These examples are referenced in the tutorial at https://aitutorial.dev. The primary purpose of these examples is to help users learn key LLM principles and techniques. When creating or modifying examples, prioritize:

- **Clean and simple code**: Focus on clarity and readability over complex optimizations
- **Learning-first approach**: Code should demonstrate concepts clearly, even if it means being more explicit than production code
- **Educational value**: Each example should teach a specific technique or principle
- **Minimal complexity**: Avoid unnecessary abstractions or advanced patterns that might distract from the core learning objective
- **Executable scripts**: Each example should be a single, self-contained script that can be executed directly
- **Useful console output**: Console output should be relevant and useful for the learning process, showing intermediate steps, results, and key insights

The goal is to make LLM concepts accessible and understandable, not to showcase production-ready enterprise patterns.

## Code Style Rules

### Function Return Types
Functions must declare return types.

### Local Variable Type Annotations
Local variables should not have explicit type annotations. TypeScript's type inference should be used instead.

Examples:
- ✅ `const result = await fetchData();` (type inferred)
- ❌ `const result: string = await fetchData();` (explicit type not needed)

Exceptions:
- When the type cannot be inferred (e.g., empty arrays: `const items: string[] = []`)
- When you need to explicitly narrow or widen the type for clarity
- When documenting complex types that aren't obvious from the assignment

## File Structure Requirements

### Main Function
Every file must have a `main` function as the first function (after imports and setup). This is mandatory - the `main` function must appear before any other function definitions in the file.

**Main function documentation (JSDoc) must follow this structure:**
1. Brief description: "Main function that demonstrates [technique/approach]"
2. Introduction: "This example shows how to [do something]:" or "This example demonstrates [concept]:"
3. Concluding note: A brief statement about the approach, its benefits, or trade-offs

Example:
```
/**
 * Main function that demonstrates structured outputs with XML mode
 * 
 * This example shows how to request XML output using prompt engineering.
 * 
 * This approach requires more parsing than JSON but provides structured output.
 */
```

**Main function body:**
- Should demonstrate the approach by running examples
- Use comments to document the steps being performed (number the steps as needed: Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- The number of steps should reflect what's needed to clearly demonstrate the approach - there's no requirement for a specific number of steps
- This allows users to understand the approach before diving into implementation details
- If `main` only calls a single function, inline that function's code directly into `main` and remove the separate function definition

### Logging Rules

**When `main` calls other functions:**
- Input and output logs (`console.log`) should be placed inside the called functions, not in `main`
- Remove all `console.log` statements from `main` that are related to function invocations
- In `main`, use only comments to document the steps being performed
- Example in `main`: `// Step 1: Classify the user's intent` followed by the function call
- Example in called function: `console.log('Input:', input); ... console.log('Output:', output);`

**When `main` does not call other functions:**
- If `main` directly makes API calls (no function calls), `console.log` statements are acceptable in `main` to show the results

### File-Level Documentation
Every file must include in its script-level documentation (the file header comment) the following three required fields:

1. **Costs & Safety**: Brief note about API costs, safety considerations, and requirements (e.g., "Real API calls; keep inputs small. Requires API key(s).")

2. **Module reference**: A markdown link to the section in the tutorial that references this example.
   - Link format: `[Section Name](https://aitutorial.dev/{module-slug}#{anchor-slug})`
   - The module-slug is derived from the MDX filename (lowercase, hyphens instead of underscores/spaces)
   - The anchor-slug is derived from the section heading where the CodeEditor appears (lowercase, spaces to hyphens, special chars removed)
   - Example: `[The Anatomy of a Production Prompt](https://aitutorial.dev/context-engineering-prompt-design/structured-prompt-engineering#the-anatomy-of-a-production-prompt)`
   - The link must point to the exact section where the CodeEditor component references this file in the deployed tutorial at https://aitutorial.dev

3. **Why**: Brief explanation of why this technique/approach is useful
